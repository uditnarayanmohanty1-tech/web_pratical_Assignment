1. How a shop website works on the Internet

A shop website works using a client-server model.
The user opens a browser and enters the website address.
The browser sends a request to the web server.
The server responds with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files.
The browser displays the shop website to the user.

Example:
When a customer opens a grocery website, the browser loads product details from the server and displays them.

2. Role of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript

HTML creates the structure of the shop website

CSS styles the website and makes it attractive

JavaScript adds interactivity like buttons, cart actions, and dynamic updates

Example:
Clicking “Add to Cart” uses JavaScript to show a message.

3. How product data is managed

Product data is stored using arrays and objects or fetched from an API.
JavaScript reads this data and displays it dynamically on the webpage.

Example:
An array stores product name and price, which is shown on the screen.

4. What is web hosting

Web hosting means storing website files on a server connected to the Internet.
This allows users to access the website anytime using a browser.

5. How a shop website can be hosted

Steps:

Create website files (HTML, CSS, JS)

Choose a hosting platform

Upload files to the server

Access the website using a URL

Example:
GitHub Pages can host a simple shop website for free.

6. Conclusion

A shop website uses HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to display products and interact with users.
Hosting makes the website available online for customers.
